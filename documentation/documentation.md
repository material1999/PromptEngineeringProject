## Introduction

Entity alignment is a critical task in knowledge graph research, focusing on identifying and linking equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs. Accurate entity alignment facilitates data integration, semantic interoperability, and the construction of unified knowledge bases, which are foundational for numerous applications in real-life scenarios.

In this project, we explore entity alignment using graph embeddings and large language models (LLMs). Initially, we generate vector representations for each node in the knowledge graph using graph embedding techniques. These embeddings enable us to measure the similarity between nodes based on their cosine similarity scores. Our current approach pairs nodes by identifying the top-1 match for each vertex based on this metric. While effective, this method may overlook nuanced relationships that could improve alignment accuracy.

To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced two-stage approach:

1. **Candidate Generation**: For each node, we will identify the top-10 most similar nodes based on cosine similarity scores derived from their graph embeddings.

2. **Refined Pairing**: Using large language models, we will further analyze the string attributes of the candidate nodes to determine the optimal alignment. This step leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs to refine alignment decisions beyond what numerical similarity scores can achieve.

This hybrid method aims to improve alignment precision by combining the structural insights from graph embeddings with the contextual analysis power of LLMs. By integrating these techniques, the project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in knowledge graph entity alignment and provide a robust framework for tackling real-world challenges in this domain.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Demonstrate the Complementary Benefits of Structural and Entity-Level Information**
   - Show how combining structural embeddings (graph-based information) with entity-specific attributes enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of entity matching in knowledge graphs.
   - Provide empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that both structural and entity-level information are critical for robust entity alignment.

2. **Showcase the Strength of Combining Basic Embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Highlight the effectiveness of a two-stage approach where basic graph embeddings generate candidate matches, and LLMs refine these matches using semantic and contextual information from string attributes.
   - Illustrate how integrating these methods bridges the gap between structural similarity and semantic understanding.

Through these objectives, the project aims to advance state-of-the-art techniques for knowledge graph entity alignment and establish a practical framework for leveraging hybrid approaches in real-world applications.

## Background and Related Work

### Knowledge Graphs and the Entity Alignment Problem
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful data structures used to represent entities and their relationships in a graph format. They are extensively employed in applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question answering. However, integrating multiple knowledge graphs is often challenging due to differences in schema, incomplete data, and inconsistencies across graphs.

Entity alignment, a critical step in integrating knowledge graphs, involves identifying equivalent entities across different graphs. This task is complicated by the need to resolve structural, semantic, and syntactic variations.

### Graph Embeddings for Entity Matching
Graph embeddings are a popular technique for representing the structural properties of knowledge graphs in a continuous vector space. Methods like DeepWalk, Node2Vec, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode nodes while preserving their relational and contextual properties. These embeddings are particularly effective for tasks like link prediction, node classification, and entity alignment. However, structural embeddings often overlook the semantic nuances of entities, limiting their alignment performance in complex scenarios.

### The Role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Semantic Analysis
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language. By leveraging pre-trained contextual embeddings, LLMs can analyze and compare string attributes of entities with a deep semantic understanding. Recent research highlights their potential in augmenting graph-based methods, particularly for tasks requiring fine-grained semantic matching.

### Hybrid Approaches for Enhanced Entity Alignment
State-of-the-art approaches for entity alignment often integrate structural and semantic methods to overcome the limitations of individual techniques. For instance, hybrid methods leverage graph embeddings for candidate generation while using LLMs or other semantic models for refining alignment decisions. Despite their promise, these methods face challenges in effectively combining structural and entity-level information, which this project aims to address.

By building on these foundational methods, this project introduces a two-stage approach that combines basic graph embeddings for candidate generation with LLMs for refined matching. This hybrid framework seeks to demonstrate the complementary benefits of structural and semantic information for robust and scalable entity alignment.
